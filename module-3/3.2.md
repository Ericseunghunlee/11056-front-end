# Module 3: Accessibility and Usability

# Usability

The aim of web usability is to allow users to accomplish their goals within your site in efficient and satisfying ways. A usable site feels intuitive, responsive, easy and safe. 

As part of accomplishing goals users will have to perform tasks. Goals might include: information seeking, communication, shopping/commerce. Tasks might include: filling in shipping details, posting to social media, searching a database.

There are many ways we can make our site more usable, for example:  
- Minimising the time it takes to the user to learn site functions and navigation.
- Allowing the user to accomplish tasks efficiently, without impediments (accessibility, load times).
- Making content easy to find (logical order, layout design).
- Automating tasks where possible (autofill, personal accounts).
- Fixing errors and re-adapting with minimal effort (form design, feedback).


There are many techniques/methodologies available to help us test the usability of our sites. Some common ones are:
- User testing: observation (talk-aloud etc.), moderated testing (Q&A, limited guidance), remote testing (task list + questionnaire), eye tracking.
- Anonymous data gathering: analytics, A/B testing (multivariate testing), survey.
- Heuristic evaluation: expert review.
- Cognitive walkthrough (aims to test whether specific tasks are completed optimally).
