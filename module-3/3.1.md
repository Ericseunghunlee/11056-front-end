# Accessibility

## What is Accessibility?

> Web accessibility basically means that people with disabilities can use the Web. More specifically, web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web.

[Understanding Web Accessibility](http://uiaccess.com/understanding.html)

Designing websites / content / experiences that do not have a barrier to use

Creating web content that can be used equally by any type of user

Building things that comply with the technical guidelines that define accessible web content

## Super important

All Australian Government websites need to be accessible. 

A good developer and designer will ensure that the sites they develop meet the WCAG guidelines. 

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

But, what are these guidelines?

> WCAG [have]... a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.

> The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including:

>*  natural information such as text, images, and sounds
>*  code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.

[W3C: WCAG Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)

You can see how the second point relates to what we've been working on when using semantic html. 

> “People who use the web have a growing variety of characteristics. As web developers, we can not assume that all our users are accessing our content using the same web browser or operating system as we are, nor can we assume they’re using a traditional monitor for output, or keyboard and mouse for input.”

[University of Washington: Accessible Technology](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/web/)

## Who do we need to think about? 

Users with:
*   Unable to see
*   Has dyslexia
*   Has low vision
*   Has a physical disability 
*   Unable to hear
*   Using a mobile device 
*   Limited bandwidth 
*   Limited time 
*   Limited mobility 
*   Limited technology

For some examples of these in practice see the great site [here]()


## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0

The guidelines follow 4 key principles:

1.   Web content must be **perceivable **
2.   Web content must be **operable**
3.   Web content must be **understandable **
4.   Web content must be **robust**

### 1. Perceivable
1.1 Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.  
1.2 Provide alternatives for time-based media.  
1.3 Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.  
1.4 Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

### 2.  Operable

2.1 Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
2.2 Provide users enough time to read and use content.
2.3 Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
2.4 Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

### 3. Understandable

3.1 Make text content readable and understandable.  
3.2 Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.  
3.3 Help users avoid and correct mistakes.  


### 4. Robust
4.1 Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

## WCAG Checklist
> It’s extremely useful to have a WCAG 2.0 checklist to hand when you’re working through the guidelines. A WCAG 2.0 checklist helps you to check your web accessibility progress, record how far you’ve come and set your targets out for the future.

See here for a number of [WCAG Checklist's](https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-checklist/)
